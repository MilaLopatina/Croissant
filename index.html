      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, crescent-shaped pastry that is a popular
      breakfast and snack food in France and many other countries. Croissants
      are made by layering dough with butter, rolling and folding the dough
      repeatedly, and then shaping it into a crescent shape before baking. This
      process creates multiple layers of dough and butter that create a light,
      flaky texture and a rich, buttery flavor. Croissants can be eaten plain or
      filled with various ingredients such as chocolate, almond paste, or ham
      and cheese. They are often served warm and accompanied by coffee or tea.
